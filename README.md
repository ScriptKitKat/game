Plot:
You have a pet bird who heard bird gossip there’s this dude who taxidermies birds and wants to create his own island city with galleries of his taxidermy bird collection
You really like your pet bird, and your pet bird is asking you to help save the birds on the island, so you do.
You go to the island. The dude is polluting the island and trashing it to build his “city” and also to kill all the pre-existing animals on the island. The dude picks the island because it also has some rare birds that aren’t part of his collection that he hasn’t found yet. You visit the island and clean the island part by part because part of the island is blocked by his construction crew idk lol (work on this part later)
